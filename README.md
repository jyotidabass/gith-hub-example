This repository is a demonstration of how to create a github repository and properly set it up.
Capstone Project Notebook (IBM Data Science - Course 9 - Lab1)
Create a new repository on your Github account and name it Coursera_Capstone. I have prepared a guide to walk you through the process of creating a repository and setting it up. For Mac users, click here. For Windows users, click here.

Now, start a Jupyter Notebook using any platform that you are comfortable with and do the following:

Write some markdown to explain that this notebook will be mainly used for the capstone project.
Import the pandas library as pd.
Import the Numpy library as np.
Print the following the statement: Hello Capstone Project Course!

Push the Notebook to your Github repository and submit a link to the notebook on your Github repository.

This Capstone Project is the first lab from the Course 9 - Applied Data Science Capstone.

# code

import pandas as pd


import numpy as np


print("Hello Capstone Project Course!")

#Output


Hello Capstone Project Course!
